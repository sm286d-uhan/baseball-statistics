    "Baseball has always been the province of statistics. Trading cards record each player's batting average, home runs and stolen bases. Many fans can recite the statistics of their favorite players. And the advent of fantasy baseball leagues has only increased fans' desire for data. Baseball statistics gained new prominence in 2003 when Billy Beane, the manager of the Oakland Athletics, rejected scouting reports and instead identified talented prospects using new statistical techniques. He used a system called _sabermetrics_ to assemble a team of low-priced and undervalued players. That team didn't win the World Series but they did much better than teams with higher payrolls. Their triumph is recounted in Michael Lewis's book, Moneyball, and in the movie of the same name, for which Brad Pitt earned an Oscar nomination (see Figure 1). "

    "Based on this success, Billy Beane was invited to coach the Boston Red Sox, an offer that would have made him the highest paid manager in baseball, though Beane turned down the offer to stay with his team in Oakland. Boston was desperate to win the World Series. The team had won the 1918 World Championship but hadn't repeated as champions despite several golden opportunities. Fans blamed the Red Sox's failures on the Curse of the Bambino. Red Sox owner Harry Frazee is said to have incurred the curse when he traded away Babe Ruth &mdash; the superstar and troublemaker who played a crucial role in the 1918 championship &mdash; to the New York Yankees for cash. Analysts didn't give the 2004 team much chance either, but the new manager, Terry Francona,  used Beane's methods to put together a team that ended the 86-year drought.  "

    "It is worth noting that even copying and pasting data from the web to the spreadsheet can be tricky! In this case, when copying the numbers to the spreadsheet Excel refuses to recognize the copied material as numbers, insisting that it is text. It turns out that there is a hidden character next to each number on the webpage that needs to be deleted before Excel can see the numbers as numeric data. Another problem in the data came from the way that innings pitched was recorded. Baseball statisticians use a number like 12.2 to indicate that 12 full innings were pitched and then 2 more batters were struck out (3 batters need to be struck out to complete an inning). However, this represents 12 and 2/3 innings pitched, which ought to be recorded as 12.66. These kinds of problems are typical for data analysis projects. Data cleaning can often take way longer than the actual analysis!"

Since baseball games are usually nine innings, you can compute his earned run average by dividing the number of earned runs (1) by the number of innings (12.66) and multiplying by 9.
